    "final_answer": "{\n \"paper_id\": \"2203.11654\",\n \"answer\": \"In the IETrans framework, the proportion of internal data transfer (k_I) has a significant positive impact on Top-10 F-Acc up to a point: as k_I increases from 10% to 80%, Top-10 F-Acc improves steadily from 17 to 31; beyond 80%, it slightly declines. In contrast, the proportion of external data transfer (k_E) has minimal effect on Top-10 F-Acc for values below 100% (stable around 10.5–11), but causes a sharp increase to 16.5 when k_E reaches 100%. This indicates that high internal transfer enhances balanced performance across head and tail classes, while full external transfer uniquely boosts long-tail generalization.\"\n}",

Experiments use the standard three SGG tasks—Predicate Classification (PredCls), Scene Graph Classification (SGCls) and Scene Graph Generation (SGGen)—and evaluate both constrained (single-output) and unconstrained (multi-output) variants. Results are presented as mR@50 and mR@100 for each task, plus an overall mean column. The compared systems include classical and recent baselines (IMP+, FREQ, SMN, KERN), structure-aware models (VCTree), a debiasing inference method (SMN+TDE), and the proposed approach (Ours). The table is organized into two main blocks (unconstrained and constrained), listing each method as rows and the six task/metric combinations as columns. The surrounding text explains the experimental setup (Faster R-CNN proposals with VGG16 backbone), the motivation for using mean recall to address long-tailed predicate distributions, and notes that some prior works do not report unconstrained metrics. Overall, the table is intended to highlight comparative gains of the proposed method across tasks and evaluation modes.",

In: Proceedings of AAAI. pp. 7631–7638 (2018) \n # A VG-1800 Dataset \n\nThe VG-1800 dataset aims to provide reliable evaluation for the large-scale scene graph generation. \n # A.1 Dataset Construction \n\nWe construct the dataset based on original Visual Genome dataset [12] by the following steps: (1) Filtration. Instead of simply auto-filtering [40] and choosing the top frequent predicate categories [1], we manually filter out unreasonable predicate categories, including misspelling predicates (e.g., i frot of), adjectives (e.g., white), nouns (e.g., car), and relative clauses (e.g., who has). To provide enough relation instances for robust evaluation, we retain all object categories and predicate categories with over 5 samples. (2) Split. We split the VG dataset into $70\\%$ training and $30\\%$ test. Following VG-50 split [31], we further split out $5,000$ images from the training set as the validation set, and ensure at least 5 samples on the test set and at least 1 samples on the training set for each predicate category. \n # A.2 Dataset Statistics \n\nFinally, the dataset contains 70, 098 object categories, 1, 807 predicate categories and 272, 084 distinct relation triplets. It consists of 66, 289, 4, 995, and 32, 893 images for training set, validation set and test set respectively. There are on average 19.5 objects and 16.0 relations for each image. \nComparison with Other VG Splits. We also compare our VG-1800 split with other splits based on Visual Genome [12] dataset, including a conventional VG\n50 and the other two large-scale SGG splits VG8K and VG8K-LT. Our VG-1800 can provide a more reliable evaluation for large-scale SGG. (1) When compared with VG8K, we provide a much cleaner dataset by manually cleaning the noise. For example, VG8K does not filter out nouns and adjectives, which will lead to an unreliable evaluation. (2) When compared with VG8K-LT, a cleaner version of VG8K, we provide a much stable evaluation for large amount of tail classes. More specifically, as shown in Table 3, our VG-1800 contains more test images. Meanwhile, VG-1800 also contains more samples of tail classes. As shown in Figure 10, our VG-1800 has 1,807 predicate classes with no less than 5 samples, while VG8K-LT has only 526 classes that have no less than 5 samples. ",

However, one of the results (Paper id 2009.00893) contains a detailed table with scene graph generation performance metrics on Visual Genome, including Recall values (labeled as mR@50 and mR@100). The method labeled \"Ours\" achieves mR@100 = 14.4 in the SGGen setting under constrained evaluation, which is far below 26.1, so this does not match.\n\nThe value 26.1 appears in the same paper (2009.00893) in the **unconstrained SGCls** setting: the proposed method (\"Ours\") achieves **mR@100 = 32.8**, which is still not 26.1. However, another entry — **KERN [3]** — achieves **mR@100 = 26.2** in SGCls (unconstrained), which is very close to 26.1. This suggests a possible typo or rounding difference, or that the user may have meant mR@100 ≈ 26.1 for SGCls.\n\nBut more critically, none of the retrieved results mention an **IETrans framework**, **k_I / k_E proportions**, or **Top-10 F-Acc**. Therefore, I need to refine my search to locate the correct paper that:\n1. Mentions the IETrans framework,\n2. Reports R@20 ≈ 26.1 on Scene Graph Classification (SGCls) on Visual Genome,\n3. Analyzes the impact of k_I and k_E on Top-10 F-Acc.\n\nGiven that the term \"IETrans\" is highly specific, I will now search for that directly."

The evaluation focuses on the predicate classification (PREDCLS) task, emphasizing the model's ability to recognize predicate classes across a highly imbalanced and diverse set of relations. Metrics include Accuracy (Acc), mean Accuracy (mAcc), their harmonic mean (F-Acc), and the number of predicate classes with at least one correct prediction (Non-Zero). Results are reported for top-1, top-5, and top-10 predictions. Baselines include BGNN, Motif, and its variants with Focal Loss, TDE, and RelMix, representing both model-agnostic and specific approaches. IETrans results are shown with two different internal transfer ratios (k_I = 10% and 90%) to explore trade-offs between Acc and mAcc. The table demonstrates that IETrans significantly improves mean accuracy and the number of predicate classes correctly predicted, highlighting its effectiveness in addressing the long-tail and semantic ambiguity challenges in large-scale scene graph generation. The method achieves superior overall performance (F-Acc) compared to all baselines, confirming its scalability and robustness in complex settings.",

scene graph generation (SGG) containing 50 predicate and 150 object classes. The evaluation covers three core SGG tasks: Predicate Classification (PREDCLS), Scene Graph Classification (SGCLS), and Scene Graph Detection (SGDET). Metrics reported include Recall@K (R@K), mean Recall@K (mR@K), and a harmonic mean metric F@K that jointly evaluates R@K and mR@K. The table compares multiple state-of-the-art approaches, including model-agnostic baselines like Resampling, TDE, CogTree, and DLFE, as well as specific models such as KERN, GBNet, BGNN, and PCPL. The IETrans method is evaluated both standalone and combined with a reweighting strategy (Rwt) across different backbone models including Motif, VCTree, GPS-Net, and Transformer. Results demonstrate that IETrans consistently improves mR@K and F@K metrics across all tasks and models, indicating enhanced performance in recognizing informative predicates and addressing long-tail distribution and semantic ambiguity issues. The table includes detailed numeric results for R@50/100, mR@50/100, and F@50/100 across tasks, highlighting IETrans’s effectiveness in boosting macro-level performance while maintaining competitive recall.",
