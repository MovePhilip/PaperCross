    "answer": "The paper proposes Edge-augmented Graph Transformer (EGT), which replaces graph convolutions with global self-attention mechanisms and introduces dedicated edge channels to process structural information.

    "answer": "According to Figure 3, the aggregation patterns formed by global self-attention in EGT vary significantly across layers and datasets. In early layers, the attention weights tend to focus on local neighbors, resembling convolutional aggregation. However, as the depth increases, the attention becomes more global, with nodes aggregating information from distant parts of the graph. This non-local and dynamic behavior is evident in the attention matrices and the distribution of averaged weights over different hop distances, particularly in deeper layers and on datasets like PCQM4Mv2 and ZINC. This demonstrates that EGT can learn to aggregate information globally, surpassing the locality constraints of traditional convolutional GNNs.",

    "answer": "According to the figure 3, multi-modal learning in the MSPLD framework improves both precision and recall at both the image and instance levels compared to not using multi-modal learning. The figure shows that, over four training iterations, the recall of mined objects and selected images increases while precision decreases, illustrating the inherent trade-off. However, with multi-modal learning, both precision and recall start at higher values and maintain better performance throughout the iterations. The mean average precision (mAP) and CorLoc metrics also steadily improve with multi-modal learning. Additionally, the parameter λ, which controls the selection of training images, increases appropriately over iterations, allowing for more images to be included in the training pool.

    "answer": "According to the figure, the experimental results show that superpixel-based region decomposition consistently outperforms grid-based decomposition in terms of mIoU on high-resolution COCO images. The left plot demonstrates that, as training progresses (increasing epochs), the superpixel approach achieves higher mIoU than the grid approach at each evaluated point. The right plot further shows that, across different base element sizes, superpixels maintain a performance advantage over grids, especially at optimal element sizes, and both methods converge at very small or very large element sizes. This provides direct evidence that superpixels are more effective than grids for dense representation learning in this context.",

      "This insight motivates us to take a progressive pose transfer scheme. In contrast to the one-step transfer scheme adopted in many previous works [5, 34], we propose to transfer a condition pose by transferring through a sequence of intermediate pose representations before reaching the target. The transfer is carried out by a sequence of Pose-Attentional Transfer Blocks (PATBs), implemented by neural networks. This scheme allows each transfer block to perform a local transfer on the manifold, therefore avoiding the challenge of capturing the complex structure of the global manifold.",

    "answer": "The main advantages are that models pretrained on large-scale uncurated internet images using self-supervised learning are more robust, fairer, less biased, and less harmful than those trained on supervised or curated datasets like ImageNet. These models capture more diverse and representative information, leading to improved performance on out-of-distribution generalization, fairness benchmarks (such as gender, skintone, and geographical diversity), and a wide range of downstream tasks.

The study finds that models pretrained on large, diverse, uncurated internet images (SEER models) have lower disparities between different genders and skintones, make fewer harmful or non-human label associations for people, and show less geographical bias, particularly improving recognition for images from low- and middle-income households and non-Western countries.

    "answer": "According to the figure 2, the tracking performance of all evaluated methods, including Tracktor, Tracktor++, FWT, jCC, MOTDT17, and MHT_DAM, generally increases with higher object visibility. However, none of the more sophisticated methods significantly outperform Tracktor in scenarios with low visibility (i.e., highly occluded objects). In particular, Tracktor achieves superior or comparable tracking ratios even for partially occluded bounding boxes with visibilities as low as 0.3. This indicates that dedicated tracking methods do not offer a clear advantage over Tracktor in handling occlusions, and that most methods—including Tracktor—are more effective in tracking objects with higher visibility.",

    "answer": "According to Figure 3, the comparison shows that all methods perform similarly well for large objects, but the ability to track decreases significantly as object size gets smaller, regardless of the method. The Tracktor-based approaches demonstrate superior performance—especially when dealing with smaller objects and imperfect detections—compared to other state-of-the-art trackers, particularly when using DPM and Faster R-CNN detections. For the gap length analysis, Tracktor also outperforms other methods in bridging longer detection gaps, maintaining higher tracking coverage even as gap length increases, especially for DPM and Faster R-CNN detections. However, with SDP detections, all methods benefit from the increased number of detections, but none show robust performance for long gaps. Thus, the figure highlights both the limitations and strengths of current tracking methods in challenging scenarios involving small objects and missing detections.",

    "answer": "According to the figure 5, the R-GMM-VGAE model demonstrates a higher ability to mitigate Feature Randomness (FR) compared to the standard GMM-VGAE, especially in the early stages of training. The charts show that the Λ_FR values for R-GMM-VGAE remain higher than those for GMM-VGAE during the initial iterations, indicating less randomness in the learned features. The normalized cumulative difference curves further illustrate that R-GMM-VGAE consistently maintains an advantage in reducing FR, although this advantage converges as training progresses and the set of reliable nodes grows. The figure also visualizes how the interplay between the two models evolves, confirming that the proposed operator Ξ in R-GMM-VGAE effectively delays the onset of Feature Randomness and improves clustering performance over time.",

    "answer": "According to the figure 3, the attention patterns in the last layer show that RoBERTa exhibits a clear diagonal line effect, indicating strong self-attention for each token, while DeBERTa's pattern is less diagonal and shows a distinct vertical strip primarily for the [CLS] token, suggesting a different distribution of attention. The DeBERTa variants without EMD, content-to-position (C2P), or position-to-content (P2C) terms display attention patterns intermediate between RoBERTa and DeBERTa, with more visible diagonals and vertical strips. This comparison visually demonstrates that the disentangled attention and enhanced mask decoding mechanisms in DeBERTa fundamentally alter how attention is distributed, reducing self-attention diagonality and emphasizing global contextual tokens like [CLS].",

    "answer": "According to figure 1, the proposed architecture processes a continuous video stream using a sliding window approach, where a lightweight detector first identifies the presence of a gesture, activating a more complex classifier only during relevant segments. The detector's probability scores indicate when a gesture is present, triggering the classifier, which then outputs raw classification scores for each gesture class. These raw scores are further refined using weighted averaging to resolve ambiguities, especially at the beginning of gestures. The final activation is determined by either early detection—when the weighted score difference between top classes exceeds a threshold during the nucleus part of the gesture—or by a late detection when the gesture ends. The bottom plot in the figure visualizes these single-time activations, with red arrows indicating early detections and black arrows indicating detections after gesture completion, demonstrating how the system ensures each gesture is recognized only once and as early as possible.",

This combination allows for more accurate pose and depth estimation, outperforming prior methods on several benchmarks.",

    "answer": "The mask-and-replace diffusion strategy is a process where, during the forward diffusion, some image tokens are stochastically masked so that the corrupted locations are explicitly known by the reverse network. This is achieved by introducing a special [MASK] token, expanding the token space to K+1 discrete states. In the reverse process, the model can focus on predicting masked tokens and correcting incorrect tokens, which helps avoid error accumulation and accelerates convergence. The benefits include making corrupted tokens distinguishable, reducing the number of token combinations to be examined, and forcing the network to understand the context rather than just focusing on masked tokens. This strategy significantly improves the efficiency and quality of the image generation process.",

    "answer": "The key innovation of the paper is the introduction of a new Group Feature Selection method for Discriminative Correlation Filters (GFS-DCF) that performs joint feature selection across both channel and spatial dimensions. This enables the model to reduce information redundancy and irrelevance in high-dimensional multi-channel features, resulting in more compact and discriminative target representations. Additionally, the method incorporates a temporal smoothness regularization using low-rank approximation to ensure robustness across frames. This is the first work to consider feature compression along both spatial and channel dimensions in DCF-based tracking.",

However, investigations aiming at reducing the information redundancy and noise across feature channels, especially as it applies to hundreds or thousands of deep CNN feature maps, are missing from the existing literature. To close this gap, in this paper, we advocate a new feature selection method, namely Group Feature Selection (GFS), for DCFbased visual object tracking."

    "answer": "According to the figure 2, the Φ-score increases rapidly with network depth in networks without Batch Normalization (BN), eventually resulting in numerical overflow (as seen in panel (a)), while with BN, the Φ-score remains much lower and more stable (panel (b)). However, this stability comes at the cost of making the Φ-score nearly constant across different architectures, which reduces its usefulness for distinguishing network expressivity (panel (e)). The Zen-Score, on the other hand, increases consistently and meaningfully with both network depth and bottleneck channel width (panels (c) and (f)), regardless of the presence of BN. This demonstrates that Zen-Score provides a scale-insensitive and robust proxy for network expressivity, effectively addressing the limitations of the Φ-score when BN is used.",

(2021), we also employ a pyramid structure for our transformer, which naturally splits the vision transformer model into multiple stages. CEL appears at the start of each stage, which receives last stage’s output (or an input image) as input and samples patches with multiple kernels of different scales (e.g., $4\\times4$ or $8\\times8$ ). Then, each embedding is constructed by projecting and concatenating these patches as opposed to solely using one single-scale patch, which endows each embedding with cross-scale features. 2) Long Short Distance Attention (LSDA) – We propose a substitute of the vanilla selfattention, but to preserve small-scale features, the embeddings will not be merged. In contrast, we split the self-attention module into Short Distance Attention (SDA) and Long Distance Attention (LDA). SDA builds the dependencies among neighboring embeddings, while LDA takes charge of the dependencies among embeddings far away from each other. The proposed LSDA can also reduce the cost of the self-attention module like previous studies (Wang et al., 2021; Chu et al., 2021), but different from them, LSDA does not undermine either small-scale or large-scale features. As a consequence, attention with cross-scale interactions is enabled."

This architecture efficiently propagates information throughout the molecular graph, allowing for a latent representation that is nearly bijective with the space of molecules and is smooth with respect to molecular properties.

    "answer": "The key innovation of the paper is the introduction of a conditional normalizing flow framework (LLFlow) for low-light image enhancement, which models the complex conditional distribution of normally exposed images given low-light inputs. The framework utilizes an encoder to extract an illumination-invariant color map inspired by Retinex theory, which serves as the mean of the prior distribution in the latent space, and an invertible network to learn a one-to-many mapping from low-light images to the distribution of normally exposed images. This approach allows for better adjustment of illumination, suppression of noise and artifacts, and richer colors in the enhanced images.",

    "answer": "The main limitations of StrongSORT and StrongSORT++ are their relatively low running speed compared to joint trackers and several appearance-free separate trackers, due to the need for an extra detector and appearance model. Additionally, although the method performs well on the IDF1 and HOTA metrics, it has a slightly lower MOTA on MOT17 and MOT20, mainly because of many missing detections caused by a high detection score threshold. Furthermore, AFLink, while effective in restoring missing associations, cannot handle false association problems and is unable to split mixed-up ID trajectories into accurate tracklets. The authors suggest that future work is needed to develop stronger and more flexible global link strategies.",

      "start_sentence": "StrongSORT and $\rm{StrongSORT++}$ still have several limitations. One concern is their relatively low running speed compared to joint trackers and several appearance-free separate trackers. This problem is mainly caused by the DeepSORTlike paradigm, which requires an extra detector and appearance model, and the proposed AFLink and GSI are both lightweight algorithms. Moreover, although our method performs well on the IDF1 and HOTA metrics, it has a slightly lower MOTA on MOT17 and MOT20, which is mainly caused by many missing detections due to the high threshold of the detection score. We believe an elaborate threshold strategy or association algorithm would help. For AFLink, although it performs well in restoring missing associations, it is helpless against false association problems. Specifically, AFLink cannot split mixed-up ID trajectories into accurate tracklets. Future work is needed to develop stronger and more flexible global link strategies."
