We show that this design helps improving the performance of our network.   \n– We finally provide a light-weighted framework that runs at over 100FPS to directly obtain 3D face reconstruction and alignment result from a single 2D facial image.   \n– Comparison on the AFLW2000-3D and Florence datasets shows that our method achieves more than 25% relative improvements over other stateof-the-art methods on both tasks of 3D face reconstruction and dense face alignment. \n # 2 Related Works \n\nAs described above, the main problems our method can solve are 3D face reconstruction and face alignment. We will talk about closely related works on these tasks in the following subsections. \n # 2.1 3D Face Reconstruction \n\nThis part we only talk about 3D face reconstruction from a single image under unconstrained situations. Since Blanz and Vetter proposed 3D Morphable Model(3DMM) in 1999[20], methods based on 3DMM are the most popular in completing the task of monocular 3D facial shape reconstruction. Most of earlier methods are to establish the correspondences of the special points between input images and the 3D mean geometry including landmarks[21,6,22,7,23,24,25] and local features[26,27,25], then solve the non-linear optimization function to regress the 3DMM coefficients. However, these methods heavily rely on the high accuracy of landmarks or other feature points detector. Thus, some methods[28,29] firstly use CNNs to learn the dense correspondence between input image and 3D template, then calculate the 3DMM parameters with predicted dense constrains. Recent works also explore the usage of CNN to predict 3DMM parameters directly. [10,11,12,13,14] use cascaded CNN structure to regress the accurate 3DMM coefficients, which take a lot of time due to iterations. [30,31,32,33] propose end-to-end CNN architectures to directly estimate the 3DMM shape parameters. Unsupervised methods have been also researched recently, [34,35] can regress the 3DMM coefficients without the help of training data by using facial texture information, which performs badly in faces with large-poses and unbalanced illuminations. However, the main defect of those methods are model-based, resulting in a limited geometry which is constrained in model shape space and post-processing to generate 3D mesh from estimated parameters. Some other methods can reconstruct 3D faces without 3D shape basis, while still rely on a 3D facial template. [36,37,38,17,39] can produce a 3D structure by warping the shape of a reference 3D model. [16] also reconstruct the 3D shape of faces by learning a 3D Thin Plate Spline(TPS) warping function via a deep network which warps a generic 3D model to a subject specific 3D shape. Obviously, the reconstructed face geometry from these methods are also restricted by the reference model, which means the structure differs when the template changes. Recently, [18] propose to straightforwardly map the image pixels to full 3D facial structure via volumetric CNN regression. This method is not restricted in the model space any more, While needs a complex network structure and a lot of time to predict the voxel data. Different from above methods, Our framework is model-free and light-weighted, can run at real time and directly obtain the full 3D facial geometry along with its correspondence information. \n # 2.2 Face Alignment \n\nIn the field of computer vision, face alignment is a long-standing problem which attracts a lot of attention. In the beginning, there are a number of 2D facial alignment approaches which aim at locating a set of fiducial 2D facial landmarks, such as classic Active Appearance Model(AMM)[40,41,42] and Constrained Local Models(CLM)[43,44]. Then cascaded regression[45,46] and CNNbased methods[3,4,19] are largely used to achieve state-of-the-art performance in 2D landmarks location. However, 2D landmarks location only regresses visible points on faces, which leads to difficulties and is limited to describe face shape when the pose of faces is large. Recent works then research the 3D facial alignment, which begins with fitting a 3DMM[47,11,48] or registering a 3D facial template[39,49] with a 2D facial image. Obviously, 3D reconstruction methods based on model can easily complete the task of 3D face alignment by selecting x,y coordinates of landmarks vertices in reconstructed geometry. Actually, [11,29,32] are specially designated methods to achieve 3D face alignment by means of 3DMM fitting. Recently [50,19] use a deep network to directly predict the heat map to obtain the 3D facial landmarks and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Thus, as sparse face alignment tasks are highly completed by aforementioned methods, the task of dense face alignment begins to develop. Notice that, the dense face alignment means the methods should offer the correspondence between two face images as well as between a 2D facial image and a 3D facial reference geometry. [15] use multi-constraints to train a CNN which estimates the 3DMM parameters and then provides a very dense 3D alignment. [28,29] directly learn the correspondence between a 2D input image and a 3D template via a deep network, while those predicted correspondence is not complete, only visible face-region is considered. Compared to prior works, our method can directly establish the dense correspondence between all region in faces and 3D template once the position map is regressed. No intermediate parameters such as 3DMM coefficients and TPS warping parameters are needed in our method, which means our network can run very fast bypassing complex operations including perspective projection and TPS transformation. \n # 3 Proposed Method \n\nThis section describes the framework and the details of our proposed method. Firstly, we introduce the characteristics of the position map for our 3D face representation. Then we elaborate the CNN architecture and the loss function designed specially for learning the mapping from unconstrained RGB image to its 3D structure. The implementation details of our method are shown in the last subsection. \n # 3.1 3D Face Representation \n\nOur goal is to regress the 3D facial geometry and its dense correspondence information from a single 2D image. Thus we need a proper representation which can be directly predicted via a deep network. One simple and commonly used idea is to concatenate the coordinates of all points in 3D face as a vector and use a network to predict it. However, this transformation increases the difficulties in training since projection from 3D space into 1D vector discards the spatial adjacency information among points. While it’s natural to think that spatially adjacent points could share weights in predicting their positions, which can be easily achieved by using convolutional layers. The coordinates as a 1D vector needs a fully connected layer to predict each point with much more parameters, which increases the network size and is hard to train. [51] proposed a point set generation network to directly predict the point cloud of 3D object as a vector from a single image. However, the max number of points is only 1024, far from enough to represent an accurate 3D face. So model-based methods[11,30,15] regress a few model parameters rather than the coordinates of points, which usually needs special care in training such as using Mahalanobis distance and inevitably limits the estimated face geometry to the their model space. [18] proposed 3D binary volume as the representation of 3D structure and uses Volumetric Regression Network(VRN) to output a $192\\times192\\times200$ volume as the discretized version of point cloud. By using this representation, VRN can be built with full convolutional layers. However, discretization limits the resolution of point cloud, and most part of the network output correspond to non-surface points which are of less usage. ",

Oh is with the Department of Computer and Radio Communications Engineering, Korea University, Seoul 02841, South Korea. ms oh@korea.ac.kr \nmainly categorized into model-based and model-free methods. The statistical PCA-based face model, so-called the 3D Morphable Model (3DMM), has established the foundations of model-based methods. 3DMM is a globally linear model, where the face shape is represented as a linear combination of basis meshes obtained from a set of collected 3D face scans. Lately, many face reconstruction methods began to employ CNNs to regress 3DMM parameters [5]–[9]. \nOn the other hand, model-free methods do not rely on a predefined face model but directly regress 3D vertices using volumetric representations [10] or UV position maps [11] for example. The idea of nonlinear 3DMM [12], [13] was also introduced, where the nonlinear decoder of a deep neural network maps the shape and texture parameters to the 3D shape and texture. Since the decoder forms the final mesh through direct vertices regression rather than the parameters, it can be considered as model-free. While 3DMM has a model space restricted to the distribution of a specific set of 3D face scans, model-free methods do not have limited representation power. Nevertheless, they tend to be computationally inefficient due to the high degrees of freedom. \nIn order to address the limitations of model-based and model-free methods, we propose a learning-based 3D face reconstruction method that uses Free-Form Deformation (FFD) [14], for the first time to the best of our knowledge. FFD is a well-known geometric modeling technique. It embeds a reference mesh within a parallelepiped grid and deforms the mesh by shifting the control points of the grid. Since our FFD-based method does not have limited representation power nor excessively high degrees of freedom, it can be seen to fall into the category between model-based and modelfree methods. It is “model-free” in the sense that it does not reflect actual face scans as in 3DMM. Our method tends to have relatively more parameters to learn than 3DMM-based methods for this reason. On the other hand, it is “modelbased” in the sense that it does not directly use vertices to represent a mesh but lower dimensional control points and mathematically defined basis functions. Thus, it requires less parameters than direct vertices regression. Our goal is to train the network to find the proper deviation of control points, which deforms the reference mesh to be similar to the target face. We summarize our main contributions as follows: ",

In the last decades, researches in these two fields benefit each other. In the beginning, face alignment that aims at detecting a special 2D fiducial points [1,2,3,4] is commonly used as a prerequisite for other facial tasks such as face recognition [5] and assists 3D face reconstruction [6,7] to a great extent. However, researchers find that 2D alignment has difficulties [8,9] in dealing with problems of large poses or occlusions. With the development of deep learning, many computer vision problems have been well solved by utilizing Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs). Thus, some works start to use CNNs to estimate the 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) coefficients [10,11,12,13,14,15] or 3D model warping functions [16,17] to restore the corresponding 3D information from a single 2D facial image, which provides both dense face alignment and 3D face reconstruction results. However, the performance of these methods is restricted due to the limitation of the 3D space defined by face model basis or templates. The required operations including perspective projection or 3D Thin Plate Spline (TPS) transformation also add complexity to the overall process. \nRecently, two end-to-end works [18] [19], which bypass the limitation of model space, achieve the state-of-the-art performances on their respective tasks. [19] trains a complex network to regress 68 facial landmarks with 2D coordinates from a single image, but needs an extra network to estimate the depth value. Besides, dense alignment is not provided by this method. [18] develops a volumetric representation of 3D face and uses a network to regress it from a 2D image. However, this representation discards the semantic meaning of points, thus the network needs to regress the whole volume in order to restore the facial shape, which is only part of the volume. So this representation limits the resolution of the recovered shape, and need a complex network to regress it. We find that these limitations do not exist in previous model-based methods, it motivates us to find a new approach to obtaining the 3D reconstruction and dense alignment simultaneously in a model-free manner. \nIn this paper, we propose an end-to-end method called Position map Regression Network (PRN) to jointly predict dense alignment and reconstruct 3D face shape. Our method surpasses all other previous works on both 3D face alignment and reconstruction on multiple datasets. Meanwhile, our method is straightforward with a very light-weighted model which provides the result in one pass with 9.8ms. All of these are achieved by the elaborate design of the 2D representation of 3D facial structure and the corresponding loss function. Specifically, we design a UV position map, which is a 2D image recording the 3D coordinates of a complete facial point cloud, and at the same time keeping the semantic meaning at each UV place. We then train a simple encoder-decoder network with a weighted loss that focuses more on discriminative region to regress the UV position map from a single 2D facial image. Figure1 shows our method is robust to poses, illuminations and occlusions. ",

            "content": "\nWe explore how FFD can be applied to 3D face meshes in the context of deep learning. Our method attempts to discover the appropriate number of control points, their distribution, and their range of influence over vertices. While 3DMM-based methods tend to be restricted in the \nspanned model space of linear bases, our method has no limit in representation power and generalizes well for unseen faces, as FFD is based on mathematically defined basis functions rather than PCA basis functions. Our method can be readily utilized for practical purposes, since the reconstructed mesh and control points can provide a solid starting point for 3D face modeling and can be easily modified for detailed adjustments by using widely available 3D software tools. Our method either outperforms or achieves comparable results to existing 3D face reconstruction methods, both in quantitative and qualitative experiments. \n # II. RELATED WORK \n\n # A. 3D Face Reconstruction from a Single Image \n\nSince Blanz et al. [15] proposed the 3DMM, it has played a dominant role in 3D face modeling and reconstruction. Later on, more advanced variants of 3DMM were designed utilizing larger 3D scan databases and higher dimensional basis [16]–[19]. Most recent methods use CNNs to regress the 3DMM parameters in a supervised manner, which are used to reconstruct 3D faces [5]–[7]. Moreover, 3DMM parameters may be found through unsupervised methods [8], [9] without the help of training data. Sanyal et al. [8] proposed a novel shape consistency loss that induces the face shape to be similar for images of the same person and dissimilar for different people. \nModel-based methods, however, have limited representation power and model-free methods [10], [11], [20] were proposed to overcome this limitation. Jackson et al. [10] proposed to map image pixels to a volumetric representation, while Feng et al. [11] developed a UV position map to represent the 3D shape. In a similar fashion, Deng et al. [20] directly regressed 3D vertex coordinates in the image space. Tran et al. [13] first introduced the concept of nonlinear 3DMM, where the decoders act as nonlinear models that map the parameters to the actual 3D shape and texture. \n # B. 3D Shape Reconstruction using Free-Form Deformation \n\nThere have been previous works that attempted to learn FFD for 3D shape reconstruction for rigid objects. Kuryenkov et al. [21] first searched for the nearest shape template from a database and applied FFD to manipulate the template to match the target image. Jack et al. [22] proposed a similar approach where they learned to deform points sampled from high-quality meshes. \nTo the best of our knowledge, FFD has never been applied to learning-based 3D face reconstruction, which is fairly different from general object reconstruction. The object reconstruction methods [21], [22] incorporated FFD using Bernstein basis functions, which is appropriate for rigid shapes, as its control points impose global influence on vertices. This method is not necessarily suitable for deformable shapes such as the human face, so we further experiment with FFD using B-spline basis functions. Moreover, they did not consider the pose of objects by using images obtained from the same viewpoint. However, considering the head orientation is important in the face domain, since human faces tend to have more obvious changes in pose. For this reason, we train our model to not only regress deformation parameters but also camera projection parameters. \n # III. METHOD \n\n # A. Deforming 3D Face Mesh with Free-Form Deformation \n\nThe goal of our method is to reconstruct the dense 3D face geometry from a single in-the-wild image. Since there are numerous vertices in a mesh, using all vertices as free variables to represent a mesh would be computationally inefficient. The more fundamental problem with this approach, however, is that these variables are not all free because the vertices should be constrained by each other to construct a mesh. Thus, we need to define new variables whose degrees of freedom are just enough to represent a mesh. For this purpose, we use FFD to represent and manipulate 3D meshes. \nFFD is a shape modification method that has been widely used for geometric modeling in computer graphics and is supported by almost all 3D softwares. It embeds a reference mesh in a parallelepiped grid and deforms it by moving the control points of the grid. Each vertex of a deformed mesh is computed by a linear combination of control points by means of coefficient basis functions [14]. Originally, FFD was implemented by using Bernstein polynomials as basis functions [23], which we refer to as Bernstein FFD. In this approach, each vertex of the mesh is influenced by all control points of the grid. Therefore, we further experiment with FFD using B-spline basis functions [14], in which each vertex is influenced by only a small number of neighbor control points. We refer to this method as B-spline FFD. \nAn arbitrary volume $\\nu(s,t,u)$ can be represented by taking a linear combination of control points using B-spline polynomials as coefficients, defined as follows: ",

            "content": "\nAlthough significant improvements have been achieved on the problem of 3D-DFAFR in a controlled setting during the past few years, 3D-DFAFR under unconstrained conditions is still yet to be well addressed. Specifically, under unconstrained conditions, as shown in Fig. 1, self occlusions caused by large pose orientation and inter-object occlusion of hair and glasses could significantly reduce the useful information in an image, making it challenging to generate good results. Meanwhile, large pose diversity will make it hard to distinguish the shape variations and increase the modeling difficulty. Previous works mainly tackle these problems by increasing the data size and diversity of training data [1], [2], [18], [22] or performing strong regularization on the shape [23]. \nTo addresses the challenges of 3D-DFAFR in the wild, this paper proposes an effective solution based on the following three motivations: (1) an occluded region in the image does not contain any face information but may negatively affect the network prediction. (2) the occluded part of a face can only be inferred through the global facial structure or prior knowledge. (3) disentangling the face pose and face shape will significantly reduce the complexity of the problem of 3DDFAFR and thus make it more tractable. Based on the above motivations, we believe occlusion and pose are two critical factors in achieving a robust 3D-DFAFR. Unfortunately, there are few 3D-DFAFR works explicitly handle with the face occlusions. The face pose estimation is also rarely discussed deeply in existing 3D-DFAFR works. Therefore, in this work, we propose to explicitly model these two factors to build a robust method for 3D-DFAFR. \nWe propose a self-aligned dual face regression network (SADRNet) for robust 3D dense face alignment and face reconstruction based on the above analysis. In particular, we present a dual face regression framework to decouple face pose estimation and face shape prediction in a low computational cost manner. These two regression networks share the same encoder-decoder backbone. They are equipped with its task-specific head design for predicting pose-dependent face and pose-independent face, respectively. The pose-independent shape regression could relieve the difficulty of directly predicting the original complex face shape under various poses and thus improve the shape prediction accuracy. Besides, to tackle the occlusion issue, we devise a supervised attention mechanism to enhance the discriminative features in visible areas while suppressing the occluded region’s influence. The attention mechanism could be plugged into our dual face regression framework to improve prediction accuracy. Finally, we propose an occlusion-aware self-alignment module to combine the pose-dependent and pose-independent faces to yield the final face reconstruction. In this alignment module, we only use the visible and sparse face landmarks to estimate the pose parameters, which could further improve the robustness of our SADRNet. Our solution significantly improves the robustness toward face occlusions in the wild. It achieves a considerable margin on both face reconstruction and dense face alignment. In summary, the main contributions of this paper are: \n• We propose a self-aligned dual faces regression framework, which is robust to face pose variation and occlusion, for the problem of 3D-DFAFR.   \nWe propose an attention-aware mechanism for visible face region regression, which can improve the regression accuracy and robustness under various situations of face occlusion.   \nThe proposed end-to-end architecture is efficient and it can run at $2 2 4 \\times 2 2 4 / 7 0$ FPS on a single GTX 1080 Ti GPU.   \nThe proposed method achieves a considerable margin on the challenging AFLW2000-3D [1] dataset and Florence 3D Faces [24] over the state-of-the-art methods. \n # II. RELATED WORK \n\n # A. 3D Face Reconstruction \n\nBlanz and Vetter [11] proposed 3DMM to represent a face model by a linear combination of orthogonal bases obtained by PCA. In this way, 3D face reconstruction can be formulated as 3DMM parameters regression problems. Later, Paysan et al. [25] extended the model by adding more scans and decomposing the expression bases from shape bases. A lot of earlier methods regressed the 3DMM parameters by solving a nonlinear optimization function [26], [5], [25], [27], [28]. Thanks to the development of deep learning, some methods [29], [1], [30], [31], [12], [16], [32], [33] started to use deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) architectures to learn 3DMM parameters and largely replaced traditional optimization-based methods with more accurate results and shorter running time. The self-supervised training of DCNNbased methods was implemented by exploiting a differentiable renderer [34], [35], [36], [37], [38], [39], [40], which alleviated the lack of 3D-supervised data and improved the generalization of networks. However, these model-based methods’ reconstruction geometry is constrained by the linear bases with limited representation power. \nSome works proposed to break the limitation by using nonlinear models [41], [42], [17], [20], [43], [41], [44]. In [19], a DCNN was used as a nonlinear 3DMM decoder. Ranjan et al. [45] used spectral graph convolutions to learn 3D faces. Zhou et al. [18] presented a nonlinear 3DMM using colored mesh decoding. Guo et al. [46] learn a more powerful nonlinear 3DMM from different data sources: scanned 3D face, RGB-D images, and RGB images. \nSome other works directly obtained the full 3D geometry to avoid the restriction of parametric models and difficulty in pose estimation [47], [2], [45]. Jackson et al. [21] proposed to use a volumetric representation of 3D face shape instead of the previously used point cloud or mesh and directly regressed the voxels. Feng et al. [2] mapped the mesh of a face geometry into UV position maps and then trained a light-weighted network that obtains the 3D facial geometry along with its correspondence information. ",

We propose a straightforward method that simultaneously reconstructs the 3D facial structure and provides dense alignment. To achieve this, we design a 2D representation called UV position map which records the 3D shape of a complete face in UV space, then train a simple Convolutional Neural Network to regress it from a single 2D image. We also integrate a weight mask into the loss function during training to improve the performance of the network. Our method does not rely on any prior face model, and can reconstruct full facial geometry along with semantic meaning. Meanwhile, our network is very light-weighted and spends only 9.8ms to process an image, which is extremely faster than previous works. Experiments on multiple challenging datasets show that our method surpasses other state-of-the-art methods on both reconstruction and alignment tasks by a large margin.

However, 3DMM has restricted representation power due to the limited number of 3D scans and global linear basis. To address the limitations of 3DMM, we propose a straightforward learning-based method that reconstructs a 3D face mesh through Free-Form Deformation (FFD) for the first time. FFD is a geometric modeling method that embeds a reference mesh within a parallelepiped grid and deforms the mesh by moving the sparse control points of the grid. As FFD is based on mathematically defined basis functions, it has no limitation in representation power. Thus, we can recover accurate 3D face meshes by estimating the appropriate deviation of control points as deformation parameters. Although both 3DMM and FFD are parametric models, deformation parameters of FFD are easier to interpret in terms of their effect on the final shape. This practical advantage of FFD allows the resulting mesh and control points to serve as a good starting point for 3D face modeling, in that ordinary users can fine-tune the mesh by using widely available 3D software tools. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate how our method successfully estimates the 3D face geometry and facial expressions from 2D face images, achieving comparable performance to the state-of-the-art methods. \nIndex Terms— 3D face reconstruction, Free-form deformation, 3D morphable model ",

Section 3 presents the method of face detection using a 3D model and details of our ConvNet including its architecture and training procedure. Section 4 presents details of experimental settings and shows the experimental results in the FDDB and AFW benchmarks. Section 5 first concludes this paper and then discuss some on-going and future work to extend the proposed work. \n # 3 The Proposed Method \n\nIn this section, we introduce the notations and present details of the proposed method. \n # 3.1 3D Mean Face Model and Face Representation \n\nIn this paper, a 3D mean face model is represented by a collection of $n$ 3D key-points in the form of $(x,y,z)$ and then is denoted by a $n\\times3$ matrix, $F^{(3)}$ . Usually, each key-point has its own semantic name. We use the 3D mean face model in the AFLW dataset [20] which consists of 21 key-points. We select 10 key-points as stated above. \nA face, denoted by $f$ , is presented by its 3D transformation parameters, $\\boldsymbol{\\Theta}$ , for rotation and translation, and a collection of 2D key-points, $F^{(2)}$ , in the form of $(x,y)$ (with the number being less than or equal to $n$ ). Hence, $f=(\\Theta,F^{(2)})$ . The 3D transformation parameters $\\boldsymbol{\\Theta}$ are defined by, $$\n\\Theta=(\\mu,s,A^{(3)}),\n$$\n",

            "content": "\nShape deformation. This paper regresses the poseindependent face S through the shape deformation, which estimates the differential 3D geometry relative to the mean face template. An alternative solution to regress S is to directly perform the estimation in UV space from scratch by the decoder layers as shown in Fig. 9d. By comparing the results in the 5th and bottom result rows in Table IV, it is easy to find that the shape regression based on deformation provides more accurate results than direct regression from scratch on all three tasks. Moreover, quantitatively comparing the improvement provided by using deformation (i.e., the bottom row over the 5th row) and that provided by using attention mechanism (i.e., the bottom row over the 3rd row), we can see the contribution of the deformation regression. Its improvement is more than that made by the attention mechanism in terms of 3D face reconstruction. \nMesh loss. Besides the losses that directly supervise the 3D coordinates of P, S, and G, inspired by [74], we also adopt losses defined on the face mesh structure, i.e., the edge length loss and the normal vector loss. They do not improve the quantitative results, but help to reconstruct the face details for better visualization. In Fig.11, we demonstrate some reconstruction results of the model trained with and without the mesh loss. In the demonstrated cases, the estimated landmarks are almost the same. However, the model with mesh loss can better reflect the difference between identities. In the first example with the mesh loss, the mouth’s openness is more suitable. In the second example, the curvature of the cheek is better, and the reconstructed model is more recognizable. In the third example, the hollow is more obvious. \n # F. Running Time and Model Size \n\nOur method has a model size of 60MB (including the mean face template parameters). In Table IV-F we compare the model sizes of the proposed method and the baseline methods. Our model is lighter than all other deep-learningbased methods. The network inference for one face image takes $1 2 \\mathrm { m s }$ on a GTX 1080 Ti GPU. The self-alignment post process (i.e., the step generating $\\mathbf { G }$ from S and $\\mathbf { P }$ ) takes 4ms on GPU or $1 . 5 \\mathrm { m s }$ on an Intel Xeon E5-2690 CPU $\\textcircled { a } 2 . 6 0 \\mathrm { G H z }$ . The fastest implementation of our method reconstructs the 3D face model from a cropped image in up to $1 3 . 5 ~ \\mathrm { m s }$ . \nThe backbone of our method, (i.e. the framework in Fig.9.a) has a model size of 52MB. The extra size introduced by the attention side branch is 7MB. The parameters of the 7-layer pose-dependent face decoder and the 7-layer pose-independent face decoder add up to 1MB. \n # G. Limitations \n\nWe note the following limitations of our work: \nOur network only regresses the shape geometry and pose, but does not reconstruct the facial texture from the input image. \n• The learning of the proposed SADRNet is fully supervised and depends on the costly face mesh annotation. Designing a weakly supervised architecture that can utilize additional data modalities (e.g., facial keypoint detection data, silhouette data, segmentation data) may improve the application potential.
