We achieve this on unconditional image synthesis by finding a better architecture through a series of ablations. For conditional image synthesis, we further improve sample quality with classifier guidance: a simple, compute-efficient method for trading off diversity for fidelity using gradients from a classifier. We achieve an FID of 2.97 on ImageNet $128\\times128$ , 4.59 on ImageNet $256\\times256$ , and 7.72 on ImageNet $512\\times512$ , and we match BigGAN-deep even with as few as 25 forward passes per sample, all while maintaining better coverage of the distribution. Finally, we find that classifier guidance combines well with upsampling diffusion models, further improving FID to 3.94 on ImageNet $256\\times256$ and 3.85 on ImageNet $512\\times512$ . We release our code at https://github.com/openai/guided-diffusion. \n # 1 Introduction \n\nOver the past few years, generative models have gained the ability to generate human-like natural language [6], infinite high-quality synthetic images [5, 28, 51] and highly diverse human speech and music [64, 13]. These models can be used in a variety of ways, such as generating images from text prompts [72, 50] or learning useful feature representations [14, 7]. While these models are already capable of producing realistic images and sound, there is still much room for improvement beyond the current state-of-the-art, and better generative models could have wide-ranging impacts on graphic design, games, music production, and countless other fields. \nGANs [19] currently hold the state-of-the-art on most image generation tasks [5, 68, 28] as measured by sample quality metrics such as FID [23], Inception Score [54] and Precision [32]. However, some of these metrics do not fully capture diversity, and it has been shown that GANs capture less diversity than state-of-the-art likelihood-based models [51, 43, 42]. Furthermore, GANs are often difficult to train, collapsing without carefully selected hyperparameters and regularizers [5, 41, 4]. \nWhile GANs hold the state-of-the-art, their drawbacks make them difficult to scale and apply to new domains. As a result, much work has been done to achieve GAN-like sample quality with likelihood-based models [51, 25, 42, 9]. While these models capture more diversity and are typically easier to scale and train than GANs, they still fall short in terms of visual sample quality. Furthermore, except for VAEs, sampling from these models is slower than GANs in terms of wall-clock time. ",

To this end, we train Generative Adversarial Networks at the largest scale yet attempted, and study the instabilities specific to such scale. We find that applying orthogonal regularization to the generator renders it amenable to a simple “truncation trick,” allowing fine control over the trade-off between sample fidelity and variety by reducing the variance of the Generator’s input. Our modifications lead to models which set the new state of the art in class-conditional image synthesis. When trained on ImageNet at $128\\times128$ resolution, our models (BigGANs) achieve an Inception Score (IS) of 166.5 and Fre´chet Inception Distance (FID) of 7.4, improving over the previous best IS of 52.52 and FID of 18.65. \n # 1 INTRODUCTION \n\nThe state of generative image modeling has advanced dramatically in recent years, with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs, Goodfellow et al. (2014)) at the forefront of efforts to generate highfidelity, diverse images with models learned directly from data. GAN training is dynamic, and sensitive to nearly every aspect of its setup (from optimization parameters to model architecture), but a torrent of research has yielded empirical and theoretical insights enabling stable training in a variety of settings. Despite this progress, the current state of the art in conditional ImageNet modeling (Zhang et al., 2018) achieves an Inception Score (Salimans et al., 2016) of 52.5, compared to 233 for real data. \nIn this work, we set out to close the gap in fidelity and variety between images generated by GANs and real-world images from the ImageNet dataset. We make the following three contributions towards this goal: \nWe demonstrate that GANs benefit dramatically from scaling, and train models with two to four times as many parameters and eight times the batch size compared to prior art. We introduce two simple, general architectural changes that improve scalability, and modify a regularization scheme to improve conditioning, demonstrably boosting performance. ",

            "content": "\nCascading pipelines have been investigated in work on VQ-VAEs (van den Oord et al., 2016c; Razavi et al., 2019) and autoregressive models (Menick and Kalchbrenner, 2019). Cascading pipelines have also been investigated for diffusion models, such as SR3 (Saharia et al., 2021), Improved DDPM (Nichol and Dhariwal, 2021), and concurrently in ADM (Dhariwal and Nichol, 2021). Our work here focuses on improving cascaded diffusion models for ImageNet generation and is distinguished by the extensive study on conditioning augmentation and deeper cascading pipelines. Our conditioning augmentation work also resembles scheduled sampling in autoregressive sequence generation (Bengio et al., 2015), where noise is used to alleviate the mismatch between train and inference conditions. \nConcurrent work (Dhariwal and Nichol, 2021) showed that diffusion models are capable of generating high quality ImageNet samples using an improved architecture, named ADM, and a classifier guidance technique in which a class-conditional diffusion model sampler is modified to simultaneously take gradient steps to maximize the score of an extra trained image classifier. By contrast, our work focuses solely on improving sample quality by cascading, so we avoid introducing extra model elements such as the image classifier. We are interested in avoiding classifier guidance because the FID and Inception score sample quality metrics that we use to evaluate our models are themselves computed on activations of an image classifier trained on ImageNet, and therefore classifier guidance runs the risk of cheating these metrics. \nAvoiding classifier guidance comes at the expense of using thousands of diffusion timesteps in our low resolution models, where ADM uses hundreds. ADM with classifier guidance outperforms our models in terms of FID and Inception scores, while our models outperform ADM without classifier guidance as reported by Dhariwal and Nichol. Our work is a showcase of the effectiveness of cascading alone in a pure generative model, and since classifier guidance and cascading complement each other as techniques to improve sample quality and can be applied together, we expect classifier guidance would improve our results too. \n # 6. Conclusion \n\nWe have shown that cascaded diffusion models are capable of outperforming state-of-the-art generative models on the ImageNet class-conditional generation benchmark when paired with conditioning augmentation, our technique of introducing data augmentation into the conditioning information of super-resolution models. Our models outperform BigGAN-deep and VQ-VAE-2 as measured by FID score and classification accuracy score. We found that conditioning augmentation helps sample quality because it combats compounding error in cascading pipelines due to train-test mismatch in super-resolution models, and we proposed practical methods to train and test models amortized over varying levels of conditioning augmentation. \nAlthough there could be negative impact of our work in the form of malicious uses of image generation, our work has the potential to improve beneficial downstream applications such as data compression while advancing the state of knowledge in fundamental machine learning problems. We see our results as a conceptual study of the image synthesis capabilities of diffusion models in their original form with minimal extra techniques, and we hope our work serves as inspiration for future advances in the capabilities of diffusion models. \n # Acknowledgments \n\nWe thank Jascha Sohl-Dickstein, Douglas Eck and the Google Brain team for feedback, research discussions and technical assistance. \n # Appendix A.

            "content": "\nIn the above derivations, we assumed that the underlying diffusion model was unconditional, modeling $p(x)$ . It is also possible to train conditional diffusion models, $p(x|y)$ , and use classifier guidance in the exact same way. Table 4 shows that the sample quality of both unconditional and conditional models can be greatly improved by classifier guidance. We see that, with a high enough scale, the guided unconditional model can get quite close to the FID of an unguided conditional model, although training directly with the class labels still helps. Guiding a conditional model further improves FID. \nTable 4 also shows that classifier guidance improves precision at the cost of recall, thus introducing a trade-off in sample fidelity versus diversity. We explicitly evaluate how this trade-off varies with the gradient scale in Figure 4. We see that scaling the gradients beyond 1.0 smoothly trades off recall (a measure of diversity) for higher precision and IS (measures of fidelity). Since FID and sFID depend on both diversity and fidelity, their best values are obtained at an intermediate point. We also compare our guidance with the truncation trick from BigGAN in Figure 5. We find that classifier guidance is strictly better than BigGAN-deep when trading off FID for Inception Score. Less clear cut is the precision/recall trade-off, which shows that classifier guidance is only a better choice up until a certain precision threshold, after which point it cannot achieve better precision. \n # 5 Results \n\nTo evaluate our improved model architecture on unconditional image generation, we train separate diffusion models on three LSUN [71] classes: bedroom, horse, and cat. To evaluate classifier guidance, we train conditional diffusion models on the ImageNet [52] dataset at $128\\times128$ , $256\\times256$ , and $512\\times512$ resolution. \nTable 5: Sample quality comparison with state-of-the-art generative models for each task. ADM refers to our ablated diffusion model, and ADM-G additionally uses classifier guidance. LSUN diffusion models are sampled using 1000 steps (see Appendix J). ImageNet diffusion models are sampled using 250 steps, except when we use the DDIM sampler with 25 steps. \\*No BigGAN-deep model was available at this resolution, so we trained our own. †Values are taken from a previous paper, due to lack of public models or samples. ‡Results use two-resolution stacks. \n # 5.1 State-of-the-art Image Synthesis \n\nTable 5 summarizes our results. Our diffusion models can obtain the best FID on each task, and the best sFID on all but one task. With the improved architecture, we already obtain state-of-the-art image generation on LSUN and ImageNet $64\\times64$ . For higher resolution ImageNet, we observe that classifier guidance allows our models to substantially outperform the best GANs. These models obtain perceptual quality similar to GANs, while maintaining a higher coverage of the distribution as measured by recall, and can even do so using only 25 diffusion steps. \nFigure 6 compares random samples from the best BigGAN-deep model to our best diffusion model. While the samples are of similar perceptual quality, the diffusion model contains more modes than the GAN, such as zoomed ostrich heads, single flamingos, different orientations of cheeseburgers, and a tinca fish with no human holding it. We also check our generated samples for nearest neighbors in the Inception-V3 feature space in Appendix C, and we show additional samples in Appendices K-M. \n # 5.2 Comparison to Upsampling \n\nWe also compare guidance to using a two-stage upsampling stack. Nichol and Dhariwal [43] and Saharia et al. [53] train two-stage diffusion models by combining a low-resolution diffusion model with a corresponding upsampling diffusion model. In this approach, the upsampling model is trained to upsample images from the training set, and conditions on low-resolution images that are concatenated channel-wise to the model input using a simple interpolation (e.g. bilinear). During sampling, the low-resolution model produces a sample, and then the upsampling model is conditioned on this sample. This greatly improves FID on ImageNet $256\\times256$ , but does not reach the same performance as state-of-the-art models like BigGAN-deep [43, 53], as seen in Table 5. \nIn Table 6, we show that guidance and upsampling improve sample quality along different axes. While upsampling improves precision while keeping a high recall, guidance provides a knob to trade \nTable 6: Comparing our single, upsampling and classifier guided models. For upsampling, we use the upsampling stack from Nichol and Dhariwal [43] combined with our architecture improvements, which we refer to as ADM-U. The base resolution for the two-stage upsampling models is 64 and 128 for the 256 and 512 models, respectively. When combining classifier guidance with upsampling, we only guide the lower resolution model. ",

A cascaded diffusion model comprises a pipeline of multiple diffusion models that generate images of increasing resolution, beginning with a standard diffusion model at the lowest resolution, followed by one or more super-resolution diffusion models that successively upsample the image and add higher resolution details. We find that the sample quality of a cascading pipeline relies crucially on conditioning augmentation, our proposed method of data augmentation of the lower resolution conditioning inputs to the super-resolution models. Our experiments show that conditioning augmentation prevents compounding error during sampling in a cascaded model, helping us to train cascading pipelines achieving FID scores of 1.48 at 64 $\\times$ 64, 3.52 at 128 $\\times$ 128 and 4.88 at $2 5 6 \\times 2 5 6$ resolutions, outperforming BigGAN-deep, and classification accuracy scores of $6 3 . 0 2 \\%$ (top-1) and $8 4 . 0 6 \\%$ (top-5) at $2 5 6 \\times 2 5 6$ , outperforming VQ-VAE-2. \nKeywords: generative models, diffusion models, score matching, iterative refinement, super-resolution \n # 1. Introduction \n\nDiffusion models (Sohl-Dickstein et al., 2015) have recently been shown to be capable of synthesizing high quality images and audio (Chen et al., 2021; Ho et al., 2020; Kong et al., 2021; Song and Ermon, 2020): an application of machine learning that has long been dominated by other classes of generative models such as autoregressive models, GANs, VAEs, and flows (Brock et al., 2019; Dinh et al., 2017; Goodfellow et al., 2014; Ho et al., 2019; Kingma and Dhariwal, 2018; Kingma and Welling, 2014; Razavi et al., 2019; van den Oord et al., 2016a,b, 2017). Most previous work on diffusion models demonstrating high quality samples has focused on data sets of modest size, or data with strong conditioning signals. Our goal is to improve the sample quality of diffusion models on large high-fidelity data sets for which no strong conditioning information is available. To showcase the capabilities of the original diffusion formalism, we focus on simple, straightforward techniques to improve the sample quality of diffusion models; for example, we avoid using extra image classifiers to boost sample quality metrics (Dhariwal and Nichol, 2021; Razavi et al., 2019). \nOur key contribution is the use of cascades to improve the sample quality of diffusion models on class-conditional ImageNet . Here, cascading refers to a simple technique to model high resolution data by learning a pipeline of separately trained models at multiple resolutions; a base model generates low resolution samples, followed by super-resolution models that upsample low resolution samples into high resolution samples. Sampling from a cascading pipeline occurs sequentially, first sampling from the low resolution base model, followed by sampling from super-resolution models in order of increasing resolution. While any type of generative model could be used in a cascading pipeline (e.g., Menick and Kalchbrenner, 2019; Razavi et al., 2019), here we restrict ourselves to diffusion models. Cascading has been shown in recent prior work to improve the sample quality of diffusion models (Saharia et al., 2021; Nichol and Dhariwal, 2021); our work here concerns the improvement of diffusion cascading pipelines to attain the best possible sample quality. \nThe simplest and most effective technique we found to improve cascading diffusion pipelines is to apply strong data augmentation to the conditioning input of each superresolution model. We refer to this technique as conditioning augmentation. In our experiments, conditioning augmentation is crucial for our cascading pipelines to generate high quality samples at the highest resolution. With this approach we attain FID scores on classconditional ImageNet generation that are better than BigGAN-Deep (Brock et al., 2019) at any truncation value, and classification accuracy scores that are better than VQ-VAE-2 (Razavi et al., 2019). We empirically find that conditioning augmentation is effective because it alleviates compounding error in cascading pipelines due to train-test mismatch, sometimes referred to as exposure bias in the sequence modeling literature (Bengio et al., 2015; Ranzato et al., 2016).

ImageNet (LSVRC2012) [52] contains roughly 1.2 million images with 1000 distinct categories and we down-sample the images to $128\\times128$ and $256\\times256$ by bicubic interpolation. We use random crop for training and center crop for testing. This dataset is challenging for image generation since it contains samples with diverse object categories and textures. We also adopt ImageNet as the main test bed during the ablation study. \nCelebA-HQ [28] is a high-quality version of the CelebA dataset [41] containing 30,000 of the facial images at $1024\\times1024$ resolution. To align with [28], we use these images for both training and evaluation. FFHQ [31] includes vastly more variation than CelebA-HQ in terms of age, ethnicity and image background, and also has much better coverage of accessories such as eyeglasses, sunglasses, and hats. This dataset consists of 70,000 high-quality images at $1024\\times1024$ resolution, out of which we use 50,000 images for testing and train models with all images following [31]. We synthesize images on these two datasets with the resolutions of $256\\times256$ and $1024\\times1024$ . \nEvaluation metrics. We adopt the Inception Score (IS) [54] and the Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) [18] for quantitative evaluation. Both metrics are calculated based on a pre-trained Inception-v3 image classifier [61]. Inception score computes KL-divergence between the real image distribution and the generated image distribution given the pre-trained classifier. Higher inception scores mean better image quality. FID is a more principled and comprehensive metric, and has been shown to be more consistent with human judgments of realism [18, 75]. Lower FID values indicate closer distances between synthetic and real data distributions. In our experiments, 50,000 samples are randomly generated for each model to calculate the inception score and FID on ImageNet and FFHQ, while 30,000 samples are produced for comparison on CelebA-HQ. Note that we follow [54] to split the synthetic images into groups (5000 images per group) and report their averaged inception score. ",

Experiments \n\nWe designed experiments to improve the sample quality metrics of cascaded diffusion models on class-conditional ImageNet generation. Our cascading pipelines consist of class-conditional diffusion models at all resolutions, so class information is injected at all resolutions: see Fig. 4. Our final ImageNet results are described in Section 4.1. \nTo give insight into our cascading pipelines, we begin with improvements on a baseline non-cascaded model at the 64 $\\times$ 64 resolution (Section 4.2), then we show that cascading up to 64 $\\times$ 64 improves upon our best non-cascaded 64 $\\times$ 64 model, but only in conjunction with conditioning augmentation. We also show that truncated and non-truncated conditioning augmentation perform equally well (Section 4.3), and we study random Gaussian blur augmentation to train super-resolution models to resolutions of 128 $\\times$ 128 and 256 $\\times$ 256 (Section 4.4). Finally, we verify that conditioning augmentation is also effective on the LSUN dataset (Yu et al., 2015) and therefore is not specific to ImageNet (Section 4.5). \nWe cropped and resized the ImageNet dataset (Russakovsky et al., 2015) in the same manner as BigGAN (Brock et al., 2019). We report Inception scores using the standard practice of generating 50k samples and calculating the mean and standard deviation over 10 splits (Salimans et al., 2016). Generally, throughout our experiments, we selected models and performed early stopping based on FID score calculated over 10k samples, but all reported FID scores are calculated over 50k samples for comparison with other work (Heusel et al., 2017). The FID scores we used for model selection and reporting model performance are calculated against training set statistics according to common practice, but since this can be seen as overfitting on the performance metric, we additionally report model performance using FID scores calculated against validation set statistics. We also report results on Classification Accuracy Score (CAS), which was proposed by Ravuri and Vinyals (2019) due to their findings that non-GAN models may score poorly on FID and IS despite generating visually appealing samples and that FID and IS are not correlated (sometimes anti-correlated) with performance on downstream tasks.

These models generate samples by gradually removing noise from a signal, and their training objective can be expressed as a reweighted variational lower-bound [25]. This class of models already holds the state-of-the-art [60] on CIFAR-10 [31], but still lags behind GANs on difficult generation datasets like LSUN and ImageNet. Nichol and Dhariwal [43] found that these models improve reliably with increased compute, and can produce high-quality samples even on the difficult ImageNet $256\\times256$ dataset using an upsampling stack. However, the FID of this model is still not competitive with BigGAN-deep [5], the current state-of-the-art on this dataset. \nWe hypothesize that the gap between diffusion models and GANs stems from at least two factors: first, that the model architectures used by recent GAN literature have been heavily explored and refined; second, that GANs are able to trade off diversity for fidelity, producing high quality samples but not covering the whole distribution. We aim to bring these benefits to diffusion models, first by improving model architecture and then by devising a scheme for trading off diversity for fidelity. With these improvements, we achieve a new state-of-the-art, surpassing GANs on several different metrics and datasets. \nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we give a brief background of diffusion models based on Ho et al. [25] and the improvements from Nichol and Dhariwal [43] and Song et al. [57], and we describe our evaluation setup. In Section 3, we introduce simple architecture improvements that give a substantial boost to FID. In Section 4, we describe a method for using gradients from a classifier to guide a diffusion model during sampling. We find that a single hyperparameter, the scale of the classifier gradients, can be tuned to trade off diversity for fidelity, and we can increase this gradient scale factor by an order of magnitude without obtaining adversarial examples [61]. Finally, in Section 5 we show that models with our improved architecture achieve state-of-the-art on unconditional image synthesis tasks, and with classifier guidance achieve state-ofthe-art on conditional image synthesis. When using classifier guidance, we find that we can sample with as few as 25 forward passes while maintaining FIDs comparable to BigGAN. We also compare our improved models to upsampling stacks, finding that the two approaches give complementary improvements and that combining them gives the best results on ImageNet $256\\times256$ and $512\\times512$ . \n # 2 Background \n\nIn this section, we provide a brief overview of diffusion models. For a more detailed mathematical description, we refer the reader to Appendix B. \nOn a high level, diffusion models sample from a distribution by reversing a gradual noising process. In particular, sampling starts with noise $x_{T}$ and produces gradually less-noisy samples $x_{T-1},x_{T-2},...$ until reaching a final sample $x_{0}$ . Each timestep $t$ corresponds to a certain noise level, and $\\boldsymbol{x}_{t}$ can be thought of as a mixture of a signal $x_{0}$ with some noise $\\epsilon$ where the signal to noise ratio is determined by the timestep $t$ . For the remainder of this paper, we assume that the noise $\\epsilon$ is drawn from a diagonal Gaussian distribution, which works well for natural images and simplifies various derivations. \nA diffusion model learns to produce a slightly more “denoised” $x_{t-1}$ from $\\boldsymbol{x}_{t}$ . Ho et al. [25] parameterize this model as a function $\\epsilon_{\\theta}(x_{t},t)$ which predicts the noise component of a noisy sample $\\boldsymbol{x}_{t}$ . To train these models, each sample in a minibatch is produced by randomly drawing a data sample $x_{0}$ , a timestep $t$ , and noise $\\epsilon$ , which together give rise to a noised sample $\\mathbf{\\Psi}_{x_{t}}$ (Equation 17). The training objective is then $||\\epsilon_{\\theta}(x_{t},t)-\\epsilon\\bar{|}|^{2}$ , i.e. a simple mean-squared error loss between the true noise and the predicted noise (Equation 26). ",

Cascading pipelines have also been investigated for diffusion models, such as SR3 (Saharia et al., 2021), Improved DDPM (Nichol and Dhariwal, 2021), and concurrently in ADM (Dhariwal and Nichol, 2021). Our work here focuses on improving cascaded diffusion models for ImageNet generation and is distinguished by the extensive study on conditioning augmentation and deeper cascading pipelines. Our conditioning augmentation work also resembles scheduled sampling in autoregressive sequence generation (Bengio et al., 2015), where noise is used to alleviate the mismatch between train and inference conditions. \nConcurrent work (Dhariwal and Nichol, 2021) showed that diffusion models are capable of generating high quality ImageNet samples using an improved architecture, named ADM, and a classifier guidance technique in which a class-conditional diffusion model sampler is modified to simultaneously take gradient steps to maximize the score of an extra trained image classifier. By contrast, our work focuses solely on improving sample quality by cascading, so we avoid introducing extra model elements such as the image classifier. We are interested in avoiding classifier guidance because the FID and Inception score sample quality metrics that we use to evaluate our models are themselves computed on activations of an image classifier trained on ImageNet, and therefore classifier guidance runs the risk of cheating these metrics. \nAvoiding classifier guidance comes at the expense of using thousands of diffusion timesteps in our low resolution models, where ADM uses hundreds. ADM with classifier guidance outperforms our models in terms of FID and Inception scores, while our models outperform ADM without classifier guidance as reported by Dhariwal and Nichol. Our work is a showcase of the effectiveness of cascading alone in a pure generative model, and since classifier guidance and cascading complement each other as techniques to improve sample quality and can be applied together, we expect classifier guidance would improve our results too. \n # 6. Conclusion \n\nWe have shown that cascaded diffusion models are capable of outperforming state-of-the-art generative models on the ImageNet class-conditional generation benchmark when paired with conditioning augmentation, our technique of introducing data augmentation into the conditioning information of super-resolution models. Our models outperform BigGAN-deep and VQ-VAE-2 as measured by FID score and classification accuracy score. We found that conditioning augmentation helps sample quality because it combats compounding error in cascading pipelines due to train-test mismatch in super-resolution models, and we proposed practical methods to train and test models amortized over varying levels of conditioning augmentation. \nAlthough there could be negative impact of our work in the form of malicious uses of image generation, our work has the potential to improve beneficial downstream applications such as data compression while advancing the state of knowledge in fundamental machine learning problems. We see our results as a conceptual study of the image synthesis capabilities of diffusion models in their original form with minimal extra techniques, and we hope our work serves as inspiration for future advances in the capabilities of diffusion models. \n # Acknowledgments \n\nWe thank Jascha Sohl-Dickstein, Douglas Eck and the Google Brain team for feedback, research discussions and technical assistance. \n # Appendix A.

A cascaded diffusion model comprises a pipeline of multiple diffusion models that generate images of increasing resolution, beginning with a standard diffusion model at the lowest resolution, followed by one or more super-resolution diffusion models that successively upsample the image and add higher resolution details. We find that the sample quality of a cascading pipeline relies crucially on conditioning augmentation, our proposed method of data augmentation of the lower resolution conditioning inputs to the super-resolution models. Our experiments show that conditioning augmentation prevents compounding error during sampling in a cascaded model, helping us to train cascading pipelines achieving FID scores of 1.48 at 64 $\\times$ 64, 3.52 at 128 $\\times$ 128 and 4.88 at $2 5 6 \\times 2 5 6$ resolutions, outperforming BigGAN-deep, and classification accuracy scores of $6 3 . 0 2 \\%$ (top-1) and $8 4 . 0 6 \\%$ (top-5) at $2 5 6 \\times 2 5 6$ , outperforming VQ-VAE-2. \nKeywords: generative models, diffusion models, score matching, iterative refinement, super-resolution \n # 1. Introduction \n\nDiffusion models (Sohl-Dickstein et al., 2015) have recently been shown to be capable of synthesizing high quality images and audio (Chen et al., 2021; Ho et al., 2020; Kong et al., 2021; Song and Ermon, 2020): an application of machine learning that has long been dominated by other classes of generative models such as autoregressive models, GANs, VAEs, and flows (Brock et al., 2019; Dinh et al., 2017; Goodfellow et al., 2014; Ho et al., 2019; Kingma and Dhariwal, 2018; Kingma and Welling, 2014; Razavi et al., 2019; van den Oord et al., 2016a,b, 2017). Most previous work on diffusion models demonstrating high quality samples has focused on data sets of modest size, or data with strong conditioning signals. Our goal is to improve the sample quality of diffusion models on large high-fidelity data sets for which no strong conditioning information is available. To showcase the capabilities of the original diffusion formalism, we focus on simple, straightforward techniques to improve the sample quality of diffusion models; for example, we avoid using extra image classifiers to boost sample quality metrics (Dhariwal and Nichol, 2021; Razavi et al., 2019). \nOur key contribution is the use of cascades to improve the sample quality of diffusion models on class-conditional ImageNet . Here, cascading refers to a simple technique to model high resolution data by learning a pipeline of separately trained models at multiple resolutions; a base model generates low resolution samples, followed by super-resolution models that upsample low resolution samples into high resolution samples. Sampling from a cascading pipeline occurs sequentially, first sampling from the low resolution base model, followed by sampling from super-resolution models in order of increasing resolution. While any type of generative model could be used in a cascading pipeline (e.g., Menick and Kalchbrenner, 2019; Razavi et al., 2019), here we restrict ourselves to diffusion models. Cascading has been shown in recent prior work to improve the sample quality of diffusion models (Saharia et al., 2021; Nichol and Dhariwal, 2021); our work here concerns the improvement of diffusion cascading pipelines to attain the best possible sample quality. \nThe simplest and most effective technique we found to improve cascading diffusion pipelines is to apply strong data augmentation to the conditioning input of each superresolution model. We refer to this technique as conditioning augmentation. In our experiments, conditioning augmentation is crucial for our cascading pipelines to generate high quality samples at the highest resolution. With this approach we attain FID scores on classconditional ImageNet generation that are better than BigGAN-Deep (Brock et al., 2019) at any truncation value, and classification accuracy scores that are better than VQ-VAE-2 (Razavi et al., 2019). We empirically find that conditioning augmentation is effective because it alleviates compounding error in cascading pipelines due to train-test mismatch, sometimes referred to as exposure bias in the sequence modeling literature (Bengio et al., 2015; Ranzato et al., 2016).

We also found increasing the training batch size from 256 to 1024 further improved performance by a significant margin. We also obtain marginal improvements by training the super-resolution model on randomly flipped data. \nSince the sampling cost increases quadratically with the target image resolution, we attempt to minimize the number of denoising iterations for our $6 4 \\times 6 4  2 5 6 \\times 2 5 6$ and 64 $\\times$ 64 128 $\\times 1 2 8$ super-resolution models. To this end, we train these super-resolution models with continuous noise conditioning, like Saharia et al. (2021) and Chen et al. (2021), and tune the noise schedule for a given number of steps during inference. This tuning is relatively inexpensive as we do not need to retrain the models. We report all results using 100 inference steps for these models. Figure 10 shows FID vs number of inference steps for our 64 $\\times$ 64 256 $\\times$ 256 model. The FID score deteriorates marginally even when using just 4 inference steps. Interestingly, we do not observe any concrete improvement in FID by increasing the number of inference steps from 100 to 1000. \n # 4.5 Experiments on LSUN \n\nWhile the main results of this work are on class-conditional ImageNet generation, here we study the effectiveness of non-truncated conditioning augmentation for a 64 $\\times$ 64 $$ 128 $\\times$ 128 cascading pipeline on the LSUN Bedroom and Church datasets (Yu et al., 2015) in order to verify that conditioning augmentation is not an ImageNet-specific method. LSUN Bedroom and Church are two separate unconditional datasets that do not have any class labels, so our study here additionally verifies the effectiveness of conditioning augmentation for unconditional generation. \nTable 5 displays our LSUN sample quality results, which confirm that a nonzero amount of conditioning augmentation is beneficial to sample quality. (The relatively large FID scores between generated examples and the validation sets are explained by the fact that the LSUN Church and Bedroom validation sets are extremely small, consisting of only 300 examples each.) We observe a similar effect as our ImageNet results in Table 3b: because the super-resolution model is conditioned on base model samples, the sample quality improves then degrades non-monotonically as the truncation time $s$ is increased. See Appendix A for examples of images generated by our LSUN models. \n # 5. Related Work \n\nOne way to formulate cascaded diffusion models is to modify the original diffusion formalism of a forward process $q \\big ( \\mathbf { x } _ { 0 : T } \\big )$ at single resolution so that the transition $q \\big ( \\mathbf { x } _ { t } | \\mathbf { x } _ { t - 1 } \\big )$ performs downsampling at certain intermediate timesteps, for example at $t \\in S : = \\{ T / 4 , 2 T / 4 , 3 T / 4 \\}$ . The reverse process would then be required to perform upsampling at those timesteps, similar to our cascaded models here. However, there is no guarantee that the reverse transitions at the timesteps in $S$ are conditional Gaussian, unlike the guarantee for reverse transitions at other timesteps for sufficiently slow diffusion. By contrast, our cascaded diffusion model construction dedicates entire conditional diffusion models for these upsampling steps, so it is specified more flexibly. \nTable 5: 128 $\\times$ 128 LSUN sample quality: non-truncated conditioning augmentation for a 64 $\\times$ 64 $$ 128 $\\times$ 128 cascading pipeline using the base model for low resolution conditioning. \nRecent interest in diffusion models (Sohl-Dickstein et al., 2015) started with work connecting diffusion models to denoising score matching over multiple noise scales (Ho et al., 2020; Song and Ermon, 2019). There have been a number of improvements and alternatives proposed to the diffusion framework, for example generalization to continuous time (Song et al., 2021b), deterministic sampling (Song et al., 2021a), adversarial training (JolicoeurMartineau et al., 2021), and others (Gao et al., 2021). For simplicity, we base our models on DDPM (Ho et al., 2020) with modifications from Improved DDPM (Nichol and Dhariwal, 2021) to stay close to the original diffusion framework. ",

CDM outperforms BigGAN-deep in terms of FID score on the image resolutions considered, but GANs perform better in terms of Inception score when their truncation parameter is optimized for Inception score (Brock et al., 2019). We also outperform concurrently released diffusion models that do not use classifier guidance to boost sample quality scores (Dhariwal and Nichol, 2021). See Fig. 8 for a qualitative assessment of sample quality and diversity compared to VQ-VAE2 (Razavi et al., 2019) and BigGAN-deep (Brock et al., 2019), and see Figs. 5 and 6 for examples of generated images. \nTable 1b reports the results on Classification Accuracy Score (CAS) (Ravuri and Vinyals, 2019) for our models at the 128 $\\times$ 128 and 256 $\\times$ 256 resolutions. We find that CDM outperforms VQ-VAE-2 and BigGAN-deep at both resolutions by a significant margin on the CAS metric, suggesting better potential performance on downstream tasks.

The CDM classifier outperforms real data on 96 classes compared to 6 and 31 classes by BigGAN-deep and VQ-VAE-2 respectively.

The first block documents improvements to a reproduced Improved DDPM baseline: a reimplementation (with dropout and longer training) and an additional sampling modification (adding forward-process noise partway through sampling and restarting the reverse process). The second block is a small-scale ablation that compares a single-stage 64×64 model to a two-stage cascade (16×16 base followed by a 16→64 super‑resolution model). The cascading runs vary the conditioning/truncation parameter s to control the amount of Gaussian conditioning augmentation applied to the low‑resolution input during super‑resolution training/sampling. Column headers list the reported metrics: model description, FID evaluated against the training set, FID evaluated against a validation set, and Inception Score (IS). Row entries include the baseline models and three cascading conditions (no conditioning augmentation and two nonzero truncation settings of the cascaded super‑resolution), allowing assessment of how conditioning augmentation/truncation affects fidelity and perceptual quality relative to the baseline.",

We achieve this on unconditional image synthesis by finding a better architecture through a series of ablations. For conditional image synthesis, we further improve sample quality with classifier guidance: a simple, compute-efficient method for trading off diversity for fidelity using gradients from a classifier. We achieve an FID of 2.97 on ImageNet $128\\times128$ , 4.59 on ImageNet $256\\times256$ , and 7.72 on ImageNet $512\\times512$ , and we match BigGAN-deep even with as few as 25 forward passes per sample, all while maintaining better coverage of the distribution. Finally, we find that classifier guidance combines well with upsampling diffusion models, further improving FID to 3.94 on ImageNet $256\\times256$ and 3.85 on ImageNet $512\\times512$ . We release our code at https://github.com/openai/guided-diffusion. \n # 1 Introduction \n\nOver the past few years, generative models have gained the ability to generate human-like natural language [6], infinite high-quality synthetic images [5, 28, 51] and highly diverse human speech and music [64, 13]. These models can be used in a variety of ways, such as generating images from text prompts [72, 50] or learning useful feature representations [14, 7]. While these models are already capable of producing realistic images and sound, there is still much room for improvement beyond the current state-of-the-art, and better generative models could have wide-ranging impacts on graphic design, games, music production, and countless other fields. \nGANs [19] currently hold the state-of-the-art on most image generation tasks [5, 68, 28] as measured by sample quality metrics such as FID [23], Inception Score [54] and Precision [32]. However, some of these metrics do not fully capture diversity, and it has been shown that GANs capture less diversity than state-of-the-art likelihood-based models [51, 43, 42]. Furthermore, GANs are often difficult to train, collapsing without carefully selected hyperparameters and regularizers [5, 41, 4]. \nWhile GANs hold the state-of-the-art, their drawbacks make them difficult to scale and apply to new domains. As a result, much work has been done to achieve GAN-like sample quality with likelihood-based models [51, 25, 42, 9]. While these models capture more diversity and are typically easier to scale and train than GANs, they still fall short in terms of visual sample quality. Furthermore, except for VAEs, sampling from these models is slower than GANs in terms of wall-clock time. ",

However, since it's cited as (Wu et al., 2019), and the result appears in a comparative table that references it, we assume this value is correct. We cannot confirm from retrieved chunks whether Wu et al. originally reported this number. So unless we can retrieve it directly, we should avoid using it due to requirement #3.\n\n3. **CDM (Cascaded Diffusion Models) (Paper id: 2106.15282)**  \n   - Table reports: CDM (ours) → IS = 128.80 ± 2.51 at 128×128.  \n   - This paper explicitly introduces CDM → valid.\n\n4. **ADM (Ablated Diffusion Model) (Paper id: 2105.05233)**  \n   - This paper introduces ADM and classifier guidance.\n   - Although no explicit 128×128 IS is listed in a dedicated row, Table 5 in the abstract and text says: “We achieve an FID of 2.97 on ImageNet $128\\times128$” with classifier guidance.\n   - Looking at the table with caption \"Figure 6: Samples from BigGAN-deep...\" ([Paper id 2105.05233]), under \"ImageNet 128×128\" section:\n     - Row: ADM-G → IS = 186.70\n   - Since this is the original paper introducing ADM and ADM-G, and it reports IS=186.70 for ADM-G on ImageNet 128×128, this counts as valid.\n\nSo the top three methods by IS on ImageNet 128×128 with results from their original papers are:\n\n- **ADM-G (Dhariwal & Nichol, 2021)** → IS = 186.70 (Paper ID: 2105.05233)\n- **BigGAN (Brock et al., 2019)** → IS = 166.5 (Paper ID: 1809.11096)\n- **CDM (Ho et al., 2021)** → IS = 128.80 (Paper ID: 2106.15282)\n\nNote: LOGAN is mentioned but not confirmed in its original paper; thus, we exclude it due to lack of direct evidence.\n\nAll values are taken from the original proposing papers, satisfying requirement #4.\n\nNow I can construct the final answer in required JSON format."

      "[INFO] Thinking: From the observations, I now have sufficient information to identify the top three methods on the Inception Score (IS) metric for ImageNet 128×128, adhering strictly to the requirements:\n\n1. Only the highest IS per paper and method.\n2. Results must come from the original paper where the method was proposed.\n3. Use only results reported in the original paper if there are discrepancies.\n\nLet’s extract and verify the relevant entries:\n\n1. **BigGAN (Paper id: 1809.11096)**  \n   - The paper states: \"When trained on ImageNet at $128\\times128$ resolution, our models (BigGANs) achieve an Inception Score (IS) of 166.5...\"  \n   - This is the original paper proposing BigGAN → valid.\n\n2. **LOGAN (Paper id: ?)**  \n   - Mentioned in [Paper id 2106.15282] table: LOGAN (Wu et al., 2019) has IS = 148.2 on ImageNet 128×128.  \n   - But we don’t have a direct chunk from the original LOGAN paper. However, since it's cited as (Wu et al., 2019), and the result appears in a comparative table that references it, we assume this value is correct.
